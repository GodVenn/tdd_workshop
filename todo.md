# Problems solved
- Testing in VSC was different from pycharm:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65577254/python-module-import-statement-runs-in-pycharm-but-not-in-vscode
- "python -m venv tdd_venv" leads to "Error: [WinError 1260] This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator"

The seven rules of a great Git commit message

    Keep in mind: This has all been said before.

    Separate subject from body with a blank line
    Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    Capitalize the subject line
    Do not end the subject line with a period
    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    Wrap the body at 72 characters
    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

# Feedback, workshop 1
- defining a selling story (before -> after) to motivate: colaboration tool, communication, commom basis of understanding between developers
- add remote
- fork
- git fundamentals
- commit before black to see the difference
- first test demonstrate, then ask people to do 
- size: 2.5 h until step 1 with an experienced  scripter
- virtual environment (is it necessary?)
