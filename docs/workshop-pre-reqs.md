# Workshop/course prerequisites

The following are the technical and non-technical pre-requisites for the workshop.

## Equinor Software Developer

Make sure that your "Equinor Software Developer" status is still valid. If not, this is an on-line session that can be booked through Learn@Equinor.

## Access to Equinors organization on github.com

You need access to Equinors Organization on github.com (github.com/equinor). Apply for access using [Access IT](https://accessit.equinor.com/).

## Windows Elevated Installer

You need _Windows Elevated Installer_ to install certain software in your development environment.
You can apply for this in [Access IT](https://accessit.equinor.com/).

## Windows 10 Developer Profile (optional)

If you are on an Equinor Managed Windows 10 Laptop there are certain things that are really difficult to do. However, for this course, Elevated Installer is enough. If you want to do anything more fancy, you might want to consider to install "Windows 10 Developer Profile". You can apply for this in [Access IT](https://accessit.equinor.com/). This requires "Equinor Software Developer" status.

## Development Environment

You need a working development environment for your computer. Please refer to [repo docs](development-environment.md) for more details.

**Please verify the development environment prior to joining the workshop!**

- Git towards github.com using SSH should work.
  - `ssh -T git@github.com`
  - Cloning a Equinor repository should give success:  
    `git clone git@github.com:equinor/tdd-workshop.git`

## Microphone and Camera

Make sure that your microphone and camera is working properly. This is an interactive workshop. In addition to knowledge transfer, the course is very much focused on discussion, team building and learning from each other. We expect all participants to engage and contribute, and we will ask everyone attending to keep their camera on during the whole course.

## Skills

Quite a few :) We expect some software development skills, but we will support you in any case.
Some rudimentary knowledge to basic Linux commands will be helpful.
